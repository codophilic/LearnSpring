# About Security
- In the world of web applications and APIs, security means protecting your data, your users' data, and the integrity of your application.
- **Without Security:**
  - A website without security is like an open house on the internet. Hackers can easily access your data, steal customer information, or even take control of your website. For instance, an online shopping website without security would allow anyone to see and change order details, customer addresses, and payment information.
- **With Security:**  
  - A secure website is like a house with a strong lock. Only authorized users can access specific information. For instance, an online banking website uses encryption to protect your account details, ensuring only you can access your money.
- The term **security** refers to protecting the application and its data from unauthorized access and malicious activities. It involves ensuring that only the right people can access certain parts of the application and perform specific actions.
- So security is important for your web application, but what type of security measures you need to consider while developing your application?
- Some of the common security measures:
  - **Encryption**: This is like scrambling data so only those with the right key (password) can understand it.
  - **Authentication**: This verifies who you are (username and password).
  - **Authorization**: This determines what you can do (access levels).
  - **Firewalls**: These act as guards, preventing unauthorized access.
  - **Intrusion Detection Systems**: These watch for suspicious activity.  
- There are many other security measures which are important. All such measures have been defined by OWASP [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
