# Design Pattern

## What is design patter in software engineering?
- In software engineering, a design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a software design. It's like a blueprint or template that can be adapted to different situations.
- Imagine you're building a house.
  - You have different parts to construct: the foundation, walls, roof, plumbing, electrical system, etc. Each part has its own complexities.
  - A design pattern is like a proven blueprint for solving such common building problems.
  - For example, you might face the challenge of how to connect the plumbing, electrical, and heating systems efficiently. Instead of figuring out a new solution every time, you can use a proven blueprint (design pattern) that outlines how to combine these systems effectively.
- Design patterns provide a shared vocabulary for software developers and can speed up the development process by providing proven solutions to common design problems.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
- To work with these complex web applications developers use different design patterns to lay out their projects, to make the code less complex and easier to work with. The most popular of these patterns is MVC also known as Model View Controller.
- Lets say you are building a simple To-do list application where users can add, view, and delete tasks. Without a clear structure, the code for managing data, handling user input, and displaying the interface can get mixed up. This makes the codebase harder to manage, debug, and extend.
- To resolve this what if we kinda seperate our code and define some sort of structure or a standard pattern? this kind of seperate of layers MVC help us to do.
- The MVC framework includes the following 3 components:
  1. Controller
  2. Model
  3. View

- Workflow
  - As a client you request for a data from a server using a web page. The web page could be static (having static contents) or dynamic (values generated by server).
  - Now if its a static content you just display the html file, but when a dynamic content is required, there are lot of works happens behind the scene.
  - **Controller** is the one which gets the request from the client. So lets say the client is requesting for a student data and on the browser it hits the page **/getStudentInfo**.
  - The **Controller** will get this request , it has multiples views or page, since the client has request for **/getStudentInfo**. It will call that view, but hold on this is a dynamic page, it requires data.
  - Database stores all the data, now the **Controller** passes the request to **Service Layer**, **Service Layer** passes the request to **DAO (Data Access Object)** and **DAO** fetch the data from the database.
  - The data transfers between these layers are of object. **DTO(Data Transfer Object)** is used to transfer the data between classes and modules of your application.
  - **DAO Layer** sends back this data to the **Service Layer**, **Service Layer** handles business logic, interacts with the DAO to retrieve data, and performs necessary data transformations or calculations,   sends back this data to the **Controller**.
  - Now the data received by **Controller** needs to be store somewhere right? so here **Model** comes into picture.
  - So **Controller** sends the data to **Model**, this data is in the **Model** form which is passed to the **View**.
  - **View** sends back the response to the client, thus generating a dynamic content on its page.

>[!NOTE]
> In some study cases, model has the capabilites to handle business logics and also perform interaction with the database.

### Controller
- The Controller receives the client's request. It's responsible for handling the initial request logic, determining which action to take, and which data to fetch.
- The Controller forwards the request to the appropriate Service Layer method, initiating the process to gather the necessary data.

### Service layer
- The Service Layer acts as an intermediary between the Controller and the DAO. It contains the business logic and orchestrates the workflow for processing the request.
- The Service Layer calls the DAO to retrieve data from the database, encapsulating business rules and possibly data transformations.

### DAO (Data-Access-Object)
- The DAO is responsible for interacting with the database. It executes database queries, fetches the necessary data, and returns it to the Service Layer.
- The DAO abstracts and encapsulates all access to the data source, providing a clean API to the Service Layer.
- The data retrieved by the DAO is passed back up to the Service Layer. The Service Layer may process this data, applying any necessary business logic, and then returns it to the Controller.

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)
- DTOs or Data Transfer Objects are objects that carry data between processes
- Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a useful concept for transferring data between different components of the application. It is often used to encapsulate data and pass it between the Model, View, and Controller.
- DTO should only contain private fields for your data, getters, setters, and constructors.
- DTO is not recommended to add business logic methods to such classes, but it is OK to add some util methods.
- E.g

```
public class StudentDTO
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int id { get; set; }
    public string city { get; set; }
    // Additional properties can be added as per your requirements
}

```

### Model
- The Model is responsible for representing the application's data structure, often as objects that the application can easily manipulate.
- The Controller may use the Model to store and organize the data before passing it to the View.

### View
- The View is responsible for presenting data to the user. It takes the data, now organized by the Model, and formats it for display in the web page.
- The View sends the final rendered content back to the client, displaying the dynamic content as requested.
