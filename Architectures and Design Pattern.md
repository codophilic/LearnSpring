# Design Pattern

## What is design patter in software engineering?
- In software engineering, a design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a software design. It's like a blueprint or template that can be adapted to different situations.
- Imagine you're building a house.
  - You have different parts to construct: the foundation, walls, roof, plumbing, electrical system, etc. Each part has its own complexities.
  - A design pattern is like a proven blueprint for solving such common building problems.
  - For example, you might face the challenge of how to connect the plumbing, electrical, and heating systems efficiently. Instead of figuring out a new solution every time, you can use a proven blueprint (design pattern) that outlines how to combine these systems effectively.
- Design patterns provide a shared vocabulary for software developers and can speed up the development process by providing proven solutions to common design problems.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
- To work with these complex web applications developers use different design patterns to lay out their projects, to make the code less complex and easier to work with. The most popular of these patterns is MVC also known as Model View Controller.
- Lets say you are building a simple To-do list application where users can add, view, and delete tasks. Without a clear structure, the code for managing data, handling user input, and displaying the interface can get mixed up. This makes the codebase harder to manage, debug, and extend.
- To resolve this what if we kinda seperate our code and define some sort of structure or a standard pattern? this kind of seperate of layers MVC help us to do.
- The MVC framework includes the following 3 components:
  1. Controller
  2. Model
  3. View

### Controller
