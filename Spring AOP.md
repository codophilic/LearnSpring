# About AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
- Imagine you have an online shopping cart.
- People will add or remove items and accordingly the quatities will be updated, calculation of total price will be done, if any discount is applicable then it will be applied , processing payment will be done etc..
- Now the core feature in this online shopping cart for individual user includes
  - User adding or removing items
  - Updating quantities
  - Calculation total price
- Other concerns which are essential but not part of core are
  - Logging users action
  - Applying discounts
  - Checking inventory
  - Processing payments
- Now these concerns could be bind with each core (each user will be assigned with inventory, logging, payments etc.) or cut it out from the core and have a generalize layer which deals with all users shopping cart.
- So which is better? to have a generalize layer rights which deals with all the users shopping cart , that is AOP.
- **AOP helps manage cross-cutting concerns—tasks ( like payments, logging, applying discounts etc..) that affect multiple parts (individual users) of an application—separately from the main logic (core features like adding or removing items from the cart)**.
- **Think of it as handling additional tasks (cross-cutting concerns) like logging user actions, checking inventory, and applying discounts. AOP allows you to define these tasks separately and automatically weave them into the shopping cart operations where needed.**
